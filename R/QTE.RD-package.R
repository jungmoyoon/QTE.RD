#' @name QTE.RD-package
#' @details
#' The package \code{QTE.RD} includes four main functions:
#' * \code{rd.qte} estimates QTEs and provides uniform confidence bands, with or without covariates,
#' and with or without robust bias correction.
#' * \code{rdq.test} conducts tests for three hypotheses, related to the significance of
#' treatment effects, homogeneous treatment effects, and uniformly positive or negative treatment effects.
#' * \code{rdq.bandwidth} implements two bandwidth selection rules:
#' the cross-validation bandwidth and the MSE optimal bandwidth.
#' * \code{plot.qte} generates figures summarizing the treatment effects along with their confidence bands.
