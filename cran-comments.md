## Resubmission

This is a resubmission. In this second round I have fixed an error in the Description field. 

This is a resubmission. In this version I have:

* Rewritten references in the description of the DESCRIPTION file.

* Removed redundant spaces in the description field.

* Added on.exit() in the plot.qte() function in order to reset par to the default values.

## R CMD check results

0 errors | 0 warnings | 0 note

* This is a new release.
