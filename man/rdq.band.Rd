\title{Uniform confidence bands for QTE}
\usage{
rdq.band(y, x, d, x0, z0 = NULL, tau, bdw, cov, alpha, print.qte = 1)
}
\arguments{
\item{y}{a numeric vector, the outcome variable.}

\item{x}{a vector (or a matrix) of covariates, the first column is the running variable.}

\item{d}{a numeric vector, the treatment status.}

\item{x0}{the cutoff point.}

\item{z0}{the value of the covariates at which to evaluate the effects.
For example, if a female dummy is included, z0 = 1 may indicate the female subgroup.}

\item{tau}{a vector of quantiles of interest.}

\item{bdw}{the bandwidth value(s). If 'bdw' is a scalar, it is interpreted as the
bandwidth for the median. The bandwidths for the rest of the quantiles are
computed automatically using the formula in Yu and Jones (1998).
If it is a vector with the same dimension as 'tau',
the function will use these values for the respective quantiles accordingly.}

\item{cov}{either 0 or 1. Set cov=1 when covariates are present in the model;
otherwise set cov=0.}

\item{alpha}{a number between 0 and 1, the desired significance level.}

\item{print.qte}{a logical flag specifying whether to print an outcome table.}
}
\value{
\describe{
\item{qte}{QTE estimates without bias correction.}
\item{qte.cor}{bias corrected QTE estimates.}
\item{uband}{uniform confidence band for QTE without bias correction.}
\item{uband.robust}{uniform confidence band for QTE with robust bias correction.}
\item{sig}{standard errors for each quantile level for estimates without bias correction.}
\item{sig.r}{standard errors for each quantile level for estimates with robust bias correction.}
\item{uband.p}{uniform confidence band for the conditional quantile estimates on the right side of the cutoff, without bias correction.}
\item{uband.robust.p}{uniform confidence band for the conditional quantile estimates on the right side of the cutoff, robust to the bias correction.}
\item{uband.m}{uniform confidence band for the conditional quantile estimates on the left side of the cutoff, without bias correction.}
\item{uband.robust.m}{uniform confidence band for the conditional quantile estimates on the left side of the cutoff, robust to the bias correction.}
}
}
\description{
\code{rdq.band} produces uniform confidence bands for QTEs with and without bias correction. This function is used by \code{rd.qte} to generate uniform bands.

# Without covariate
